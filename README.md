This is the Website based on the Front-End System used by Customers, Admins, and Managers to book and manage bookings of driving lessons. The system is built on the Asp .net C# programming language.

Business processing	

The business processing of the website is aligned with that of the front-end system, as all the information that it uses is from a central database that is also used by the front-end system. The website reflects the Front-end system in some sense.



Usability	

The interface was made in such a way that the most important tasks that the user (Customer, Instructor, Admin) may want to perform are easy to access, understand, and use.  A help sub-system was successfully integrated. The user interface was made to conform to most of user interface design standards set by other large companies therefore the system almost behave like any other system which makes it easy to predict.


Security	

When it comes to security we successfully implemented it. There are 3 ways to register as either a customer with an id, a customer without id or an instructor. Each user that logs in whether a customer, instructor, or admin are directed to their account settings. No one else can access a particular account except the user themselves.


Business Intelligence Reports
	
The website implemented some of the reports which include a mixture of power bi dashboards and crystal reports.
